# 💡 MoneyWise – Gamified Financial Literacy Platform  
**Innovate4FinLit Hackathon Submission**

MoneyWise is a **gamified, offline-first financial literacy platform** that transforms real-world money decisions into interactive simulations.  
It helps **students and young adults** learn budgeting, saving, debt management, credit behavior, and investing through **hands-on gameplay and behavioral analytics**, not passive theory.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial literacy education today is often:

- Disconnected from real-life decision-making  
- Inaccessible without consistent internet access  
- Unable to measure actual learning outcomes  

MoneyWise addresses these gaps by converting **financial behavior into gameplay**, allowing users to learn by making decisions and seeing real consequences.
