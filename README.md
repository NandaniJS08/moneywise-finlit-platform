**Innovate4FinLit Hackathon Submission**

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://nandanijs08.github.io/moneywise-finlit-platform/

MoneyWise is a **gamified, offline-first financial literacy platform** that transforms real-world money decisions into interactive simulations.  
It helps **students and young adults build real financial habits** around budgeting, saving, debt management, credit behavior, and investing through **hands-on gameplay and behavioral analytics**, not passive theory.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial literacy education today is often:

- Disconnected from real-life decision-making  
- Inaccessible without consistent internet access  
- Unable to measure real learning outcomes  

MoneyWise addresses these gaps by converting **financial behavior into gameplay**, allowing users to learn by making decisions and experiencing real consequences.
